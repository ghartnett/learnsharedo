During my research, I read the following story in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Switch-Change-Things-When-Hard\/dp\/0385528752\/\">Switch: How to Change Things When Change is Hard<\/a> by Chip and Dan Heath.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Researchers at Stanford University conducted an experiment to find the factors in getting students to donate food to charity. They first asked students to rate their perception of their classmates\u2019 willingness to donate to charity. In effect, the researchers categorized the students as either \u201csaints\u201d or \u201cjerks\u201d. They then provided each student with one of two sets of instructions.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Basic instructions:\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n    A well known location on campus to bring some tinned food\n  <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n  Detailed instructions:\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n    A map with the location of place to bring the tinned food\n  <\/li>\n<li>\n    A specific request - a tin of beans\n  <\/li>\n<li>\n    A suggestion to the student to think of a time when they would be near the location\n  <\/li>\n<li>\n    A follow up call to remind them where and when to donate\n  <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n  Of those who received the basic instructions, 8% of the saints and 0% of the jerks donated food. This was not entirely surprising. Of those who received the detailed instructions, 42% of the saints and 25% of the jerks donated food.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  That\u2019s right, jerks who received detailed instructions were more likely to donate than saints with basic instructions. If you\u2019re hungry, you\u2019re more likely to get food from a jerk with a map than a saint without one.\n<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"post-84-_puytcz9zmf2q\"><\/a>When?<\/h2>\n<p>\n  \u2026 you\u2019re trying to get someone to do something or change their behavior in a specific way...\n<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"post-84-_eddo56e0ma31\"><\/a>How?<\/h2>\n<p>\n  Provide detailed instructions. Anticipate decisions the person will need to make and give them concrete options. Make it easy for them to take action or make the right decision. The Heath brothers call this \u201cShaping the Path\u201d.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  This experiment is also mentioned in Bob Sutton\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Good-Boss-Bad-Learn-Worst\/dp\/0446556076\">Good Boss, Bad Boss: How to Be the Best... and Learn from the Worst<\/a>. In a section titled \u201cBe Repetitive and Concrete\u201d he suggests providing checklists which were used during World War 2 by B-17 pilots. Early in its lifetime, the B-17 was considered difficult to fly but a set of checklists for takeoff, flight, landing and taxiing tamed the complexity. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Checklist-Manifesto-How-Things-Right\/dp\/0312430000\">Checklists were also used in medicine by Atul Gawande<\/a> to reduce to number of infections post surgery.\n<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"post-84-_hjgl83bu88t8\"><\/a>Why?<\/h2>\n<p>\n  As the Heath brothers say, \u201cwhat looks like a people problem is often a situation problem.\u201d People only have capacity for a finite number of decisions in a day. The less thinking they need to do the more likely they are to take action.\n<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"post-84-_qldu27rj6hey\"><\/a>The bigger picture<\/h2>\n<p>\n  This is an example of a guideline that we use in this blog\/publication.
