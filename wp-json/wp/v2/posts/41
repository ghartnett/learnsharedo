During the interviews I noticed a common theme.<\/p>\n<p>Sanita Puspure, the winner of a rowing world championship last year spoke about her ambitions to be Olympic champion next year. Her coach, David McGowan said:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cWe have a good routine now of just looking at session by session and not getting overwhelmed with the big picture and just focus on doing everything we can daily as well as we can.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Later in the show, Sin\u00e9ad Ahern the captain of the Dublin women\u2019s football team said,<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cIf you want to stay ahead of the chasing pack, you have to improve, you have to innovate. If you start to look down the line you forget the things you have to do to get there.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Earlier this year after winning the All-Ireland Hurling championship one of the Limerick players, Seamus Hickey said,<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cwe were trying to replace that emotion with regular dependable practice, stuff that you can rely on when things go bad.\u201d <\/em><\/p>\n<p>Aside: for readers outside of Ireland, hurling is an indigenous Irish sport, one of the oldest and fastest field sports. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.balls.ie\/gaa\/random-the-er-episode-where-george-clooney-talks-about-watching-irish-hurling-40190\">George Clooney<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.the42.ie\/hurling-fan-bruce-springsteen-dedicates-glory-days-to-limericks-munster-heroes-996282-Jul2013\/\">Bruce Springsteen<\/a> are fans. Jason Statham\u2019s character in the film \u201cBlitz\u201d describes hurling as <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hurling_in_popular_culture\">\u201ca cross between hockey and murder\u201d<\/a>. Beyond that, it\u2019s hard to explain in a few lines so I\u2019d suggest you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VUSZD4awiLo\">watch this short video of highlights from Limerick\u2019s win<\/a> in this year\u2019s All-Ireland Final.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/goals-systems\">As James Clear says, \u201cwinners and losers have the same goals.\u201d<\/a> At the start of an event, all competitors have a goal to win. The winners are usually those who put together the best \u201csystem of continuous small improvements\u201d during the training, race, game or season.<\/p>\n<p>In business, <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2017\/08\/find-the-right-metrics-for-your-sales-team\">good sales teams focus on leading indicators<\/a>. A leading indicator is a predictive measurement, for example; a number of demos, customer calls or new meetings. By contrast,  \u201ca closed deal is an outcome and a lagging indicator; it can\u2019t be used by the salesperson or sales manager to improve future outcomes.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Leading indicators correspond to things a rep can control and focus on day to day. A sales manager can then focus on helping individual reps and their own leading indicators: interviews, hiring, coaching & training.<\/p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2GsHH3B\">\u201cPrinciples\u201d, Ray Dalio speaks of systematizing<\/a> his business, specifically:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Decision making<\/li>\n<li>Models of markets, portfolios and economies<\/li>\n<li>Learning from mistakes<\/li>\n<li>Good management<\/li>\n<li>Idea meritocracy<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>His concept of principle is similar to that of the guidelines we\u2019ll be writing about on this blog. We\u2019ll return to this in future posts.<\/p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2MOL71A\">\u201cThe E-Myth Revisited\u201d, Michael Gerber<\/a> explains the importance of seeing a business as a system. He tells the story of how Ray Kroc \u201cset about the task of creating a foolproof, predictable business. A systems-dependent business not a people-dependent business. A business that could work without him.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"post-41-_puytcz9zmf2q\"><\/a>How?<\/h2>\n<p>Ryan Holiday\u2019s lists a number of ways to build better habits and systems in his <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/s\/notes-on-changing-your-life\/how-to-develop-better-habits-in-2019-143e1e21ecbc\">article \u201cHow to Develop Better Habits in 2019\u201d<\/a>. Here are three examples:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Think small - \u201cDon\u2019t promise yourself you\u2019re going to read more; instead, commit to reading one page per day.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Lay Out Your Supplies - \u201cWhen I get to my desk in the morning, the three journals I write in are sitting right there\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Pick Yourself Up When You Fall - \u201ctripping is inevitable\u2026 It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a bad person. I\u2019ve always been fond of this advice from Oprah: If you catch yourself eating an Oreo, don\u2019t beat yourself up; just try to stop before you eat the whole sleeve.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Niklas G\u00f6ke recommends <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/personal-growth\/you-dont-need-motivation-you-need-rational-habits-3f600c7472a5\">finding your \u201crational habit\u201d for every goal<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cFor every goal you can think of, rational habits exist. They either support it directly or make it more likely you\u2019ll follow through on the actions that do\u2026 Motivation isn\u2019t something we can properly maintain. Rational habits are. They\u2019re rooted in action, not inspiration.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I use an application called Things as a system to organise my projects and actions (tasks). I\u2019ve set up recurring reminders, some are daily (triage email in two timeboxed batches), some are less frequent (clean the dishwasher filter).<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve also created simple processes\/systems I follow. For example, when planning my day at work I:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look at my \u201cimportant\u201d projects to find the \"One Thing\" that MUST get done and will deliver the most impact<\/li>\n<li>Look at my calendar to figure out how much time I have between meetings to get things done<\/li>\n<li>Prioritise tasks for today: the planned actions I didn\u2019t complete the previous day, tasks from my prioritised projects and new reminders.<\/li>\n<li>Then I prune the list to down to the things I\u2019ll be able to do in the time I have available<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>James Clear has written a whole book on this subject <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2MMPni8\">\u201cAtomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones\u201d<\/a>. I\u2019ve purchased a copy and added the book to my reading queue.

Hint: it\u2019s you.<\/li>\n<li>Make a note - \u201cafter every writing session... write a note to yourself about what you\u2019re going to write the next time.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>When you\u2019re writing, write.<\/li>\n<li>Do it again tomorrow.
