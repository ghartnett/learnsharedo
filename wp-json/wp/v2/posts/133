In this post, I complete the series by outlining Newport\u2019s Rules 2-4:\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n    Embrace Boredom\n  <\/li>\n<li>\n    Quit Social Media\n  <\/li>\n<li>\n    Drain the Shallows\n  <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n  As before, I have organized these insights, examples and guidelines within the framework and headings of the book. In a way, these are my detailed notes from the book.\n<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"post-133-_vabgl52iqxgq\"><\/a>Rule #2: Embrace Boredom <\/h2>\n<p>\n  Example: Orthodox Jews spend time every weekday studying the religious texts such as the Talmud. Some read alone. Others discuss the text in pairs or bigger groups.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Insight: concentration is something that must be trained.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Insight: Clifford Nass a behavior and communications researcher, discovered attention switching has negative effects on the brain. People who multitask find it hard to filter irrelevance.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  While Rule #1 (Work Deeply) helps one reach the peak of concentration, this rule helps extend that peak or limit.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Guideline: take breaks from focus rather than breaks from distraction. Taking a whole day, an Internet or technology \u201csabbath\u201d won\u2019t help. Schedule your breaks in advance and deep work until then. As I write this, my iPad is disconnected from the internet. I\u2019ll take a short break in 19 minutes. I usually work in pomodoros, but that\u2019s another story for another post.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Guideline: work intensely like Teddy Roosevelt. Identify a difficult but important task and give yourself less time to do it than you\u2019d normally take. Set a countdown timer. I now have 15 minutes to my next break and I hope to have this section finished by then.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Insight: artificial deadlines are like interval training for the attention centers of your brain.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Guideline: meditate productively. Focus on a problem you\u2019re trying to solve while doing something else physically (walking, driving, showering). When your attention wanders, gently bring it back to the problem you\u2019re trying to solve. This requires practice.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Example: Daniel Kilov is a memory athlete. He wasn\u2019t born with a strong memory but he worked on it and over time this training helped his general abilities.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Insight: memory researchers discovered the elite memorizers direct their attention. They don\u2019t use rote memorization. They\u2019ll use techniques like representing a card as a person then imagining that person in a place in their house.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Guideline: practice focusing your attention. Memorization, meditation, playing music and reading the Talmud are all examples of attention training.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  I finished this section with 90 seconds to spare so I\u2019m going to go back and check spelling before a 5 minute break when I\u2019ll stretch my left achilles and make a cup of tea.\n<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"post-133-_f4h295azawgm\"><\/a>Rule #3: Quit Social Media <\/h2>\n<p>\n  Right, I\u2019m back for another 25 minutes.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Insight: electronic communication and social media, fragment our attention and erode our ability to concentrate. Social media is designed to keep our attention and get us to consume things.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Guideline: accept social media can be useful but set a threshold for using them.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Insight: throughout history, craft workers carefully selected the tools they worked with.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Guideline: use a structured process to identify the communication tools you\u2019ll use.\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n    Identify your top level goals\n  <\/li>\n<li>\n    List 2-3 activities that help you achieve each goal\n  <\/li>\n<li>\n    Assess each network tool for it\u2019s positive and negative impacts\n  <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n  Example: Newton mentions Twitter and the author Michael Lewis.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Guideline: assess whether the tool\u2019s benefits outweigh it\u2019s drag on your attention.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Insight: the \u201claw of the vital few\u201d (or Pareto principle), 80% of an effect is due to 20% of the possible causes.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Insight: social media services are products from private companies that have massive funding &amp; revenues. They employ talented people who capture and sell your attention (and personal details) to advertisers.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Guideline: be deliberate in selecting your entertainment. Modern humans have access to so much good content. Don\u2019t use social media or the auto suggestions of an algorithm to decide what to consume in the moment. Create lists of quality alternatives in advance.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Insight: Newton quotes Arnold Bennett discussing structured relaxation:\n<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cthe mental faculties are capable of a continuous hard activity; they do not tire like an arm or a leg. All they want is change\u2014not rest, except in sleep.<\/em>\u201d\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  My 25-minute timer just went off. Time to take a break and check the news (I have notifications turned off).\n<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"post-133-_k8p7kmpol16p\"><\/a>Rule #4: Drain the Shallows <\/h2>\n<p>\n  Insight: most knowledge work needs some amount of shallow work (checking email, meetings).\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Insight: deep work is exhausting. It pushes you to the limit of your cognitive abilities. Researchers like Anders Ericsson (of deliberate practice fame) have estimated the upper limit to be four hours a day.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Guideline: schedule every minute of the day. Don\u2019t spend the day on autopilot. I work in half hour blocks of time (pomodoros) and move things around as I work through the day (because no day runs perfectly to plan).\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  I just realized I forgot to restart my pomodoro timer after that \u201cnews break\u201d.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Insight: on some days you\u2019ll rewrite the schedule multiple times. The goal is not to stick to a rigid schedule but to be thoughtful and deliberate about what you\u2019ll do with the time remaining.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Guideline: if you uncover a promising insight, rework the schedule.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Guideline: quantify the depth of each activity. This can be hard to do. Newton recommends asking yourself - how long would it take to train a recent college graduate to do this activity?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Guideline: ask your boss for a shallow work budget. For most knowledge workers this should be in the region of 30-50%. Below 30% you could become a hermit who thinks big thoughts but doesn\u2019t communicate.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Insight: this limit frees up time for more important activities and stops shallow work from filling up your day. We tend to fall into shallow work moment by moment and not see the cumulative impact.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Guideline: don\u2019t work after 5:30pm. Newton calls this fixed-schedule-productivity.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Guideline: beware of saying \u201cyes\u201d, the most dangerous word in the knowledge worker\u2019s vocabulary. When saying no, be clear in your refusal but ambiguous for the reason. For example, \u201cthat sounds interesting but I can\u2019t do that because of scheduling conflicts\u201d.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Insight: fixed-schedule-productivity is a meta-habit that switches you into a scarcity mindset and attunes you to disruptive requests for shallow work. It makes the default answer \u201cno\u201d.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Guideline: become hard to reach. Email is impossible to avoid but anyone with your address can send a message that consumes more time than it took to write. Newton has some specific guidelines for those who want to be open to contact from the general public like a form or FAQ with checklists.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Guideline: do more work when you send or reply to emails. Newton calls this the process-centric approach to email. Identify the process (or project) the email relates to then the current and next steps. This can reduce the number of responses and time spent rereading the thread in future, saving time in the long run.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Guideline: don\u2019t reply if:\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n    The email is ambiguous\n  <\/li>\n<li>\n    It\u2019s not a question that interests you\n  <\/li>\n<li>\n    Nothing good\/useful would happen if you responded and nothing really bad would happen if you didn\u2019t.\n  <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n  On the latter, Newton quotes Tim Ferris: \u201cdevelop the habit of letting small bad things happen. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll never find time for the life-changing big things, whether important tasks or true peak experiences.\u201d\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Personally it drives me crazy when I receive a long email and the key information or the important action I\u2019m expected to take, is hidden in the second sentence of the third last paragraph. I have developed some standard replies like\u2026\n<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cThank you for your detailed email. It\u2019s not clear what action you expect me to take, so I\u2019m assuming none is required. If some action is required, please reply to let me know.\u201d<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  I\u2019m a big believer in action-based communication but that\u2019s yet another story for another day.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Insight: deep work can be intense and cause uneasiness. It\u2019s easier to be artificially busy and swim in the shallows. As you get closer to producing your best work you can become nervous that your best is not yet good enough.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Insight: deep work can generate a life rich with productivity and meaning. Newton finishes the book with a quote from Winifred Gallagher, \u201cI\u2019ll live the focused life, because it\u2019s the best kind there is.\u201d\n<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"post-133-_qldu27rj6hey\"><\/a>Postscript<\/h2>\n<p>\n  In the time since reading the book I\u2019ve been finding some of Newport\u2019s rules or guidelines have made their way into my daily work. I\u2019m using a work-shutdown ritual and scheduling the day with tasks from my GTD projects. In some cases I\u2019ve modified guidelines I\u2019ve been using for years. I schedule deep work for 2-3 hours every second day. I\u2019ve started using the Pomodoro technique again because it seems to resonate with some of Newton\u2019s ideas.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Thanks for reading!\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  If you have any other examples or feedback please comment\/follow\/share below or on: <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/learnsharedo\">twitter<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/learnsharedo\">medium<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/linkedin.com\/company\/learnsharedo\">linkedin<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  If you\u2019d like to write for LearnShareDo, please send an email to (write at learnsharedo dot com).\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Credits: photo by <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/@dlyster?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Devin Lyster<\/a> on <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/s\/photos\/drain?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash<\/a>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Disclosure: some links in this post may use Amazon affiliate links.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Summary In post 1 and post 2 of this series, I outlined earlier sections of this book Deep Work by Cal Newport.
