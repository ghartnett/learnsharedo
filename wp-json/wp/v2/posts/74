This can be useful for teams in a work setting or for you as an individual (i.e. school projects).\n<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"post-74-_bv94k27p2dw\"><\/a>Examples &amp; Stories<\/h2>\n<p>\n  A couple of years ago I did some research on best practices for doing project\/incident postmortems. This is a summary of what I learned.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  The phrase \u201cNever let a good crisis go to waste\u201d is <a href=\"https:\/\/realbusiness.co.uk\/as-said-by-winston-churchill-never-waste-a-good-crisis\/\">sometimes attributed to Winston Churchill<\/a>. It\u2019s a phrase I heard a number of times in Ireland during the financial meltdown of 2008-2011. Ever since, if something goes wrong at home or at work, the quote pops into my head.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  In my day job, we sometimes encounter situations that don\u2019t go a well as they could have; a customer issue takes too long to solve or some process or product doesn\u2019t work as well as it should. To learn from the situation, we usually do a blameless postmortem or a learning review. Typically, in work situations, more than one person is involved in the situation and the review.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  I have also done a personal learning review when something goes wrong or I receive feedback on something I could have done better. In general, I am trying to focus on building on my strengths but if an issue causes a significant impact, I have found it is worth spending time to do a learning review.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Camille Fournier in her excellent book <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B06XP3GJ7F\/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=learnsharedo-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B06XP3GJ7F&amp;linkId=b1feed48948c57cd907d13b4bd776b0a\">The Manager\u2019s Path<\/a>, suggests using the term \u201clearning review\u201d instead of postmortem. In the book Camille explains:\n<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cthe \u201cpostmortem\u201d process is a critical element of good engineering. In fact, instead of calling the process a postmortem, many have started calling it a \u201clearning review\u201d to indicate that its purpose is not determining cause of death but learning from the incident.\u201d<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Etsy: an online marketplace, have <a href=\"https:\/\/extfiles.etsy.com\/DebriefingFacilitationGuide.pdf\">published a postmortem facilitation process<\/a>. Their 20-page process builds on <a href=\"https:\/\/codeascraft.com\/2012\/05\/22\/blameless-postmortems\/\">blog post by John Allspaw in 2012<\/a>. In the process Etsy describe:\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  \u201c<em>the goal is not to find the cause of an accident. The goal is to seize the opportunity for an organization to learn as much as they can, in a relatively short period of time, about how people normally perceive and perform their work. Because the people involved were doing their normal work on a normal day when the event in question happened.\u201d<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  We\u2019ll see more details on how Etsy run postmortems below.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Google have documented their postmortem process in the <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2DhXC2D\">book \u201cSite Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems\u201d.<\/a> Like Etsy they also strive for blameless post mortems:\n<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cFor a postmortem to be truly blameless, it must focus on identifying the contributing causes of the incident without indicting any individual or team for bad or inappropriate behavior. A blamelessly written postmortem assumes that everyone involved in an incident had good intentions and did the right thing with the information they had.\u201d<\/em>\n<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"post-74-_puytcz9zmf2q\"><\/a>How?<\/h2>\n<p>\n  At a high level I recommend doing a learning review in three separate phases:\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n    Document what happened at the time - an initial timeline. Try to avoid blaming yourself or others during this phase. Focus on the facts and rationale for decisions during the event.\n  <\/li>\n<li>\n    Decide what to do - find remediation actions to resolve the issue or change processes to reduce the likelihood the issue will happen in the future.\n  <\/li>\n<li>\n    Implement the remediation actions and follow-up later.\n  <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n  A learning review is more effective when you separate the reflection about what happened (past) from deciding what to do about it (future).\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  If you\u2019re trying to understand a personal issue, use a notebook (paper or electronic). Ask anyone who might observed something during the issue, to provide input.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  When documenting what happened for a group learning review, you can use a shared electronic document. Ask everyone involved to add to the timeline of what happened. Remember, the people involved did what they thought was the right thing at the time.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Try not to ask \u201cwhy\u201d something happened because that could imply a judgement. Instead, ask \u201chow\u201d. What was the rationale? What data was the decision or action based on? This is a subtle but important distinction.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Camille Fournier makes the following recommendations in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B06XP3GJ7F\/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=learnsharedo-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B06XP3GJ7F&amp;linkId=b1feed48948c57cd907d13b4bd776b0a\">The Manager\u2019s Path<\/a>:\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n    Resist the urge to point fingers and blame\n  <\/li>\n<li>\n    Look at the circumstances around the incident and understand the context of the events\n  <\/li>\n<li>\n    Be realistic about which takeaways are important and which are worth dropping\n  <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n  Etsy recommend a four step process:\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n    Gather the initial timeline - the people closest to the event gather objective data and construct a timeline of events. <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n        Sometimes the data can be scattered in different places (support cases\/tickets, emails, chat messages, phone logs).\n      <\/li>\n<li>\n        The timeline doesn\u2019t need to include every detail.\n      <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n    Hold a debriefing meeting - to gather subjective data (opinions, judgments, assumptions, beliefs). <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n        The attendees read the initial timeline before the meeting\n      <\/li>\n<li>\n        Up front, the facilitator should try to establish a sense of trust with all participants. \u201cWe will be focusing on the HOW of what happened, not the WHY.\u201d\n      <\/li>\n<li>\n        Walkthrough the timeline - everyone asks questions. Look for descriptions not explanations.\n      <\/li>\n<li><em>\u201cPause at intervals during debrief discussions and ask people to raise their hands if they have learned something they didn\u2019t know before.\u201d<\/em>\n      <\/li>\n<li>\n        The facilitator adds additional notes to the timeline. The main focus is the timeline but if remediation ideas come up, note them to discuss later.\n      <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n    Pivot towards learning<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n        This can happen in a separate meeting or a distinct phase of the debriefing meeting.\n      <\/li>\n<li>\n        Brainstorm \u201clearning points\u201d which may include remediation actions\n      <\/li>\n<li>\n        Choose a small subset of the team to take the brainstorm list of \u201clearning points\u201d and reflect on them.\n      <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n    Report on the viability of the \u201clearning points\u201d and remediation actions<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n        Two or three days later, the sub-team reports back on the viability of the remediation points.\n      <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\n  Google\u2019s process has more suggestions on what to do after the \u201clearning points\u201d are decided.

We\u2019ll learn more from mistakes or omissions if we can be as open and honest with ourselves as possible. This is easier if you can separate the activity of gathering the facts from deciding what to do.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  Why ask \u201chow\u201d instead of \u201cwhy\u201d? In the Etsy guide they explain:\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  \u201c<em>Asking \u201chow\u201d enables us to hear other people\u2019s stories.
