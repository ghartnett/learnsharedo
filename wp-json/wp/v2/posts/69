Niall knew I\u2019d be interested because the guideline concept in this blog, is inspired in part by design patterns. One of our goals is to curate great knowledge. When I saw Kate\u2019s article was already in the form of patterns, I decided to share it here and do what I can to promote it further.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n  In this post, I\u2019ll summarize the guidelines in her article with a few additional maxims from my experience. I encourage you to read <a href=\"https:\/\/queue.acm.org\/detail.cfm?id=3308563\">the full article<\/a> (after you\u2019ve read this summary of course).\n<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"post-69-_rme7pzpdqb4y\"><\/a>When?<\/h2>\n<p>\n  In all of these situations you\u2019re in a conversation with your manager or manager\u2019s manager or someone even higher in your organization.\n<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"post-69-_q9aza62iw22v\"><\/a>The Guidelines<\/h2>\n<p>\n  These short guidelines each have three sections:\n<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>When:<\/strong> you could apply the guideline\n  <\/li>\n<li><strong>What: <\/strong>you could do in the situation\n  <\/li>\n<li><strong>Why: <\/strong>it is important to do this\n  <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><a id=\"post-69-_jcig1dtu3lor\"><\/a>Guideline: when you don\u2019t know something, admit it &amp; commit to follow-up<\/h4>\n<p><strong>When<\/strong>: you\u2019ve just been asked a question and you don\u2019t know the answer. <strong>What:<\/strong> avoid saying a simple \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d or guessing an answer. Say something like \u201cI don't know, but Phyllis does and I will ask her and get back to you by the end of the day\u201d. <strong>Why:<\/strong> you don\u2019t want to look stupid (now or later).\n<\/p>\n<h4><a id=\"post-69-_rkfjhbiisevi\"><\/a>Guideline: be the bearer of bad news &amp; give a timeline<\/h4>\n<p><strong>When<\/strong>: something goes wrong and it\u2019s your responsibility. <strong>What<\/strong>: a) let your boss know about the problem right away, b) share the next steps, c) give a timeline. If you don\u2019t know when the problem will be solved, say when you\u2019ll provide an update. Don\u2019t over-analyse the problem, give your boss a head\u2019s up straight away. A previous boss of mine had a mantra - \u201cno big surprises\u201d. <strong>Why<\/strong>: you should own the message. It\u2019s worse if your boss hears about the problem from someone else. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability\/dp\/0321965515\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=don't+make+me+think&amp;qid=1553123159&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=learnsharedo-20&amp;linkId=2ccc7e411c4d7049b441689f89bf8400&amp;language=en_US\">Don\u2019t make her think<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n<h4><a id=\"post-69-_wje9mmesjk9t\"><\/a>Guideline: when you hear a dubious decision, don\u2019t react, ask questions &amp; commit<\/h4>\n<p><strong>When<\/strong>: sometime a decision will be made that you don\u2019t agree with. <strong>What<\/strong>: there\u2019s a right way and a wrong way to disagree. First take a breath. Ask about the context and rationale. Remember, someone up there thinks this is a good idea.

I know it\u2019s easier said (or written) than done but your boss is unlikely to change her mind if you freak out. If you can\u2019t change her mind at least you\u2019ll have a better explanation when you explain it to your direct reports (or kids). Finally if you still disagree, consider <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove\/dp\/0679762884\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=high+output+management&amp;qid=1553122584&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=learnsharedo-20&amp;linkId=6eea15ab99616658e67a40223b0684e7&amp;language=en_US\">Andy Grove\u2019s advice<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Disagree_and_commit\">\u201cdisagree and commit\u201d<\/a>. <strong>Why<\/strong>: you might not have all the information the decision maker had.\n<\/p>\n<h4><a id=\"post-69-_2b9clal4lbwq\"><\/a>Guideline: when you receive negative feedback: pause, accept and commit<\/h4>\n<p><strong>When<\/strong>: you\u2019re going to do something wrong sometime. If your boss is any good she\u2019ll tell you in a skillful and constructive way. <strong>What<\/strong>: in the article, Kate recommends you say \"I hear you. I will be more mindful of that in the future.\" Personally I\u2019d use slightly different words but the sentence would have that form. Like the previous guideline, I\u2019d also \u201cseek first to understand, then be understood\u201d. <strong>Why<\/strong>: getting defensive makes your boss have to work harder to try to help you learn. Most bosses don\u2019t like to deliver negative feedback. This guideline is also easier said than done but you\u2019ll learn more faster if you don\u2019t get defensive.\n<\/p>\n<h4><a id=\"post-69-_fk4x4ox6x4hs\"><\/a>Bonus guideline: when you need your boss to take action, make it really clear<\/h4>\n<p>\n  This guideline is not in Kate\u2019s original article but it\u2019s something I try to do (and I encourage my direct reports to do also). <strong>When: <\/strong>we all need help at times and you\u2019ll need your boss to take action or make a decision. <strong>What<\/strong>: make it super clear by mentioning the action you are requesting at the start of any written communication. If email, you could put a keyword (like #ACTION or #URGENT) in the subject. <strong>Why<\/strong>: your boss probably gets twice as many emails and juggles three times as many issues as you do. She is not going notice a subtle, indirect request in the third last paragraph of a long email.\n<\/p>\n<h2><a id=\"post-69-_qldu27rj6hey\"><\/a>The bigger picture<\/h2>\n<p>\n  This post is a summary of guidelines from an article.
